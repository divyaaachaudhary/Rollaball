# Rollaball
This is a beginner-friendly 3D game developed in Unity where the player controls a rolling ball to collect floating items across the level. I implemented smooth physics-based movement using Unity’s Rigidbody system and scripted the item collection mechanics using C#. The game includes a simple UI to track the number of collected items and trigger win conditions. I handled the full development cycle, including player input, collision logic, score tracking, and basic level design. This project helped strengthen my understanding of Unity’s physics system and foundational game mechanics.
